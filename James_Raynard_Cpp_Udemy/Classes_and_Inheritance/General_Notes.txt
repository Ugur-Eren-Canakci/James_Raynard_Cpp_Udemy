A derived class object is stored in memory as a base class object, followed by the derived class part
When a derived class object is created, the base class's constructor is called first, then the derived class's constructor
When destroyed, the derived class destructor is called first. Then the base class destructor is called

Ex:
class Vehicle {
private:
    double max_speed;
    ...
public:
    Vehicle(double max_speed) : max_speed{max_speed} {}
    ...
};

class Aeroplane : public Vehicle {
private:
    double max_height;
public:
    // constructor
    Aeroplane(double max_speed, double max_height) : Vehicle(max_speed), max_height{max_height} {
        ...
    }
};


A child class inherits all the non-private member functions of its parent class

Public access:
    a public member of a class is accessible from any part of the code
    a child class will have access to all its parents' public members but not to the private members
        If you want some members to be accessible from the child class but no other code, 
        you should put those members into the "protected" section
