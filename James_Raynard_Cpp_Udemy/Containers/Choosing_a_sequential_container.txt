Deque is slightly slower than vector for most operations
    Faster than vector for adding or removing elements at the front
    
List is much slower than vector and deque for most operations
    But much faster when adding or removing elements if the position to add/remove is known
    
Vector should be the default choice
    Modern hardware is optimized for accessing contiguous blocks of memory
