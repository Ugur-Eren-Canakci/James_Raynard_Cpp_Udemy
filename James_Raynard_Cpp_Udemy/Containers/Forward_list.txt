Nodes contain a value and a pointer to the next node

The last node has a nullptr, so it's possible to deduce the end of a forward list from that

Also called a "singly-linked list"

std::forward_list

Adding an element:
    Create a node
    Make the last node point to the new one
    
Adding an element to the middle
    Create a node
    Copy the previous item's pointer to the new node
    Insert the new node's address to the previous node's pointer

Removing an element:
    Make the previous node point to the next node
    Destroy node
    
Usually, sequential containers have insert() and erase() methods
    std::forward_list only supports forward iterators
        Use insert_after() and erase_after()
        These will add or remove an element after a given location
