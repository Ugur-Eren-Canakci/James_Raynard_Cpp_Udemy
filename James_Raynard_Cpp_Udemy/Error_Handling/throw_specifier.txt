void func() throw(Exception1, Exception2) {
    ...
}
if func is to throw any exception outside Exception1 and Exception2, the program terminates immediately

void func_2() throw() {
    ...
}
func_2 cannot throw any exceptions, or the program terminates immediately

some problems:
    this list of exceptions is not checked by the compiler
    
    if the list of exceptions is incorrect, the program might terminate unexpectedly
    
throw() was deprecated in C++11
    throw(arg_list) was removed completely in C++17
        throw() was removed completely in C++20
and replaced by "noexcept" keyword
