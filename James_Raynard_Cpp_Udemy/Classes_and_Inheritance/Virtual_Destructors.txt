When a derived object is pointed by a Base* pointer, due to static binding, the Base destructor is called at the end of the stack
    Or similarly, when delete is called on the pointer, same thing happens
    
=> We need to make the Base destructor virtual.

The default destructor synthesised by the compiler is NOT VIRTUAL
    => we have to define the destructor explicitly as a virtual function
    
In general, if a class has virtual functions, it should also have a virtual destructor.
