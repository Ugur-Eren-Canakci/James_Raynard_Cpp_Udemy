There are situations which arise at runtime when the environment doesn't behave as expected

Communicate with the user
    Tell user what the problem is and what they can do about it
    Give opportunity to retry, resolve, or ignore as appropriate
    If necessary, notify other concerned parties

Avoid information which is not helpful to the user
    
Only exit the program as a last resort

Often, errors can be handled where they occur
    Sometimes it's useful to handle errors in a different part of the code 
    Ex: a pop-up for a network error
    
A better approach is to have these errors handled at higher levels
    The error needs to be passed from the place where the error occured to the code that handles it
