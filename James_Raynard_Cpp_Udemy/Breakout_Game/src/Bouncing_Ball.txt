We need to make the ball bounce when it hits an obstruction

add getter functions to return:
    the current position of the ball
    its centre
    its bounding rectangle
    
we add these member functions to the entity class
    we will need these features for detecting collisions with the bricks
        bricks are not of moving_entity type, so this is the reason we add the getters to the entity
        
    SFML has some functions for detecting collisions
        these use the bounding rectangles
