    // nullptr
    
    // literal, representing a null pointer
    // it's a special type, convertible to any other pointer type, but cannot be converted to an int
    // the traditional NULL has value 0
    // the type of NULL is implementation defined
    // func(NULL); calls func(int) with clang, calls func(int *) with VC++ and doesn't compile with gcc.
