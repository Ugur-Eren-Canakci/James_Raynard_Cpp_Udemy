sf::Text
    represents a graphical text
        can be drawn on a render target
        
    has an associated sf::Font object
        functionality quite similar to sprites and textures
        
        use loadFromFile to load a font
        Ex:
        sf::Font verdana;
        verdana.loadFromFile("path/to/font/verdana.ttf")
            fails if the font is not available on the system or is not in the directory
        sf::Text text;
        text.setFont(verdana);
        text.setString("hello");
        
We will add a member for the number of "lives" the player has
    Each time the ball hits the bottom of the window, the player loses a life
    When the player has no life left, the game is over
    If the player survives long enough to destroy all the bricks, they win the game
    
We add more values to the game state
    enum class game_state {paused, game_over, running, player_wins};

We add text objects to display messages
