When the ball hits a brick, 
    1) the brick is destroyed
        i.e. deleted from the vector 
    2) the ball bounces back off
    
we will:
    1) add move_down() member function to moving_entity
    2) Add a member to store the "destroyed" state
    3) add getter and setter for the destroyed member
    4) add functions to get the edges of the sprite
    
brick and ball collision:
    handle_interaction overload to handle collision of bricks and the ball
    
    the collision can occur on all 4 sides
    
    we also need to consider the ball's direction of travel
    
overlaps
    
    left overlap = ball right - brick left
                 = (ball origin + ball width) - (brick origin)
    
    right overlap = brick right - ball left 
                 = (brick origin + brick width) - (ball origin)  
    
    top overlap = ball bottom - brick top
                 = (ball origin + ball width) - (brick origin)
    
    bottom overlap = ball top - brick bottom
                 = (ball origin) - (brick origin + brick width)
                 
    left overlap < right overlap => collision on left
    right overlap < left overlap => collision on right
    top overlap < bottom overlap => collision on top
    bottom overlap < top overlap => collision on bottom
    
    yet, it's possible to hit two edges at the same time
        closer to left than top/bottom => move left
        closer to right than top/bottom => move right 
        closer to top than left/right => move up
        closer to bottom than left/right => move down
