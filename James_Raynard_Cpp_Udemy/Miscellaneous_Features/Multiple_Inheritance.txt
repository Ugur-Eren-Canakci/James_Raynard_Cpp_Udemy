A derived class can have multiple base classes

Quite controversial
    Adds complexity
    Many programmers and OO designers don't like it
    Some languages don't support it
    
However, multiple inheritance can be useful for writing mix-in classes

class Derived : public Base1, Base2 {
    ...
};

Stored in memory with Base1 as the first part, Base2 as the second part, and rest belongs to Derived's members

Derived inherits all non-private members of the base classes

If we call an inherited member function from Derived, its name must only be defined in one Base class
    solution: define the commands you want inside the Derived class so no ambiguity comes up
