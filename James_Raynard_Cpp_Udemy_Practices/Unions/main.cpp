    // the members are kept in the same memory address, and only one member is well-defined at a time
    // you can only have one member of each possible type
    // each member is public by default

    // a better version of union, keeping what member is defined at a time in a new member called "tag"
    
    //Why are tagged unions useful?
    // reduces the likelihood of reading the wrong member
