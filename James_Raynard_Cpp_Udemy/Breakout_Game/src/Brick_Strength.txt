sf::Color
    The components are 8-bit unsigned integers 
    They define the contribution each component makes to the result
    0 defines none, 255 defines max
    sf::Color(255,0,0) => red
    
    has a fourth argument that defaults to 255 and goes down to 0
        called alpha
        decides the opaqueness of the color, i.e. how much of the background it shows
        
    
handle_interaction(ball&, brick&) will change as we will not destroy bricks immediately
    if strength > 1 strength--;
    else is_destroyed = true;
    
brick::update() will also change
    will set the color of the brick depending on its strength
