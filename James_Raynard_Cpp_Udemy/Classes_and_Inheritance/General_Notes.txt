A derived class object is stored in memory as a base class object, followed by the derived class part
When a derived class object is created, the base class's constructor is called first, then the derived class's constructor
When destroyed, the derived class destructor is called first. Then the base class destructor is called

Ex:
class Vehicle {
private:
    double max_speed;
    ...
public:
    Vehicle(double max_speed) : max_speed{max_speed} {}
    ...
};

class Aeroplane : public Vehicle {
private:
    double max_height;
public:
    // constructor
    Aeroplane(double max_speed, double max_height) : Vehicle(max_speed), max_height{max_height} {
        ...
    }
};
