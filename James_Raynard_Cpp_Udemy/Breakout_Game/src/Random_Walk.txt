SFML has two vector classes:
    sf::Vector2
        represents a 2-dim vector
        members x and y can be accessed directly
        supports arithmetic operations, == and !=
        template class
    sf::Vector2f
        Alias for sf::Vector2<float> instantiation
        SFML uses float internally
        
sf::Texture represents an image
    The image has been loaded into the graphics card
    It can be drawn on a render target
    The drawing is done inside the graphics card
    
    Mainly useful for things which you're going to be displaying very frequently
    
sf::Shape represents a pre-defined texture
    Abstract base class
    Can be drawn on a render target
    Has an associated "texture rectangle"
    All transformations are relative to "the origin" of the Shape
        By default, top left-hand corner of the texture rectangle
    
sf::CircleShape
    subclass of sf::Shape, sf::ConvexShape and sf::rectangleShape
