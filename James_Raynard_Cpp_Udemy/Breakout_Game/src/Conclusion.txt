The game code is modular, and easy to understand (except for the entity_manager)

Adding a new entity type to the game is straightforward
    Derive a class from entity or moving_entity
    Load its image file in the constructor
    Override update()
    Add data members and member functions
    Create and register objects in game_manager::reset()
    Add collision handling code to game loop if required
    
Room for improvement?
    Further code refactoring
    Fix some minor ball/paddle interaction issues
    Adding levels with faster ball, tougher bricks, etc
    Make damaged bricks appear cracked
    Randomize brick strengths, reflection angles etc. to add variety
    Add sound effects
    
This code is good for:
    Implementing simple games
    Prototyping
    
Not suitable for performance-critical games
    vector reallocation
    virtual function calls
    run-time type info
    inheritance trees can become comples
    poor cache locality when iterating
