std::valarray 
    vector-like type, based on Fortran arrays
        fixed size
        easier syntax for numerical operations
    not widely used
        poorly designed
        compiler implementers not interested in optimizing it
        better to use third party libraries
        
C++11 has std::complex in <complex>
    templated type (for the types of the real coefficients of the base vectors)
        can be float, double or long double
        
    we can insert them to streams
        displayed as "(real, imaginary)"
    we can extract them from streams as well, if they're in the form above
    
    supports usual arithmetic operations
        not the increment/decrement operations though
        
C++14 provides the literal suffix i
    returns a std::complex object whose real part is 0.0
    
There are non-member functions to convert the complex number to and from polar coordinates
    abs(), arg(), conj()
    
exp, log, pow, sqrt, sin, cos, tan, inverse trig and hyperbolic trig funcs are all supported
