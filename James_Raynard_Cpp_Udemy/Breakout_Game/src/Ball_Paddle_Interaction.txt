We need to detect and resolve collisions between entities

void handle_collision(ball &b, const paddle& p);
    makes the ball bounce off the paddle
    an overload will make the ball destroy a brick
    
bool is_interacting(const entity& e1,const entity& e2); 
    returns true if e1's bounding box overlaps with e2's
    
These two will be non-member functions
    In C++ we write functions as member functions only if the function is part of the class interface
