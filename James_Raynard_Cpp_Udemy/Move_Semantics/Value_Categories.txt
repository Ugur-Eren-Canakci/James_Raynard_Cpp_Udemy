lvalues represent persistent objects
    These occupy memory which is accessible to the programmer
    
    They remain valid until they go out of scope or are deleted
    
    Ex:
    local vars
    global vars
    static vars
    function arguments
    
rvalues are stored in locations which are not accessible to the programmer, such as processor registers
    Literals like 2 or 'c'
    
    they are temporary objects
        Destroyed in the same statement in which they are created
        

C++ has three value categories:
    1) Literals
        No name
        Cannot be referred to again
        Called "prvalues" (pure rvalues)
    2) Temporary objects
        Represent an object 
        Data can be moved
        Called "xvalues" (expiring values)
    3) lvalues
    
    Every expression has a type and a value category
    
lvalue and rvalue sets are complements of each others
    xvalue and prvalue sets are subsets of the rvalue set
    
lvalues and xvalues are objects
    their dynamic types can be different fron their static types
    collectively known as "generalized lvalues"
