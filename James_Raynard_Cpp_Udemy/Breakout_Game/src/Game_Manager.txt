We need to refactor the code 
    main() is too long (after adding ball and brick interactions)
        ideally shouldn't be longer than one screen
        
        
=> we start by moving the code from main() into a new class
    new class called "game"
        data members will be:
            game window
            the ball
            the vector of bricks
            the paddle
            the background
            
        member functions will be:
            constructor to initialize entities
            run() to perform the game loop
            reset() to re-initialize the entities
            
        we will also add a feature to allow the user to pause the game
            while the game is paused, the entities are still redrawn
                however, they are not updated
                
            will be managed by an enum class
                enum class game_state {paused, running}
        we also allow the user to restart the game
