A child class inherits all the non-private member functions of its parent class
Public access:
    a public member of a class is accessible from any part of the code
    a child class will have access to all its parents' public members but not to the private members
        If you want some members to be accessible from the child class but no other code, 
        you should put those members into the "protected" section
