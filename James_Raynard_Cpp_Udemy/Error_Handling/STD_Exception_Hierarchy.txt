std::logic_error 
    represents something that is under the control of the programmer
        ex: violating a precondition such as going over the container's limits to dereference garbage values
    
    can be prevented by the programmer
        ex: checking function arguments before processing them
        
std::runtime_error 
    represents something that's not under the control of the programmer
        ex: running out of memory
        
std::exception defines five public member functions:
    constructor
    copy constructor
    assignment operator
    virtual what()
    virtual destructor
    
    what() returns a C-style string
    what cannot throw an exception
    
exception, bad_alloc and bad_cast have a default constructor
    the others don't have a default constructor, but have a constructor that takes a string argument
        either C-style or C++ string
