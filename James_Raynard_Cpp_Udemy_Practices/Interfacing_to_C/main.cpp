    //Why is name mangling significant when interfacing with C?
    // C doesn't mangle its functions' names, so if we want to use a function defined in C++ to be compatible with C, we have to tell
    // the C++ compiler to not mangle its name
    
    //What do we need to do to avoid having issues with name mangling?
    // extern "C" command works
    // can take a single function, a list of functions, or a whole header file as an argument, and keeps the function name same 
    
    // Write a simple C++ function
    // Write a simple C program that calls your function
