a texture is an image loaded to the graphics card

sf::Sprite represents a texture associated with a rectangle
    similar to sf::Shape but we provide our own image
    
    represents a group of pixels as a single graphical entity
    
    this entity floats over the display like a ghost
    
    the name "sprite" is an archaic name for ghost
    
to create a sprite, we need a texture first.
    sf::Texture texture;
    
    use loadFromFile() texture member function to load a texture into the graphics card:
    texture.loadFromFile("picture.jpg"); (returns bool, so check)
        this will fail if:
            1) the image file is not valid
            2) The image file is not in the expected directory
            
    then use setTexture() sprite member function to associate a texture argument with the sprite object:
    sf::Sprite sprite;
    sprite.setTexture(texture);
    
In the game we will create several sprites, to represent the different entities within the game
    we're going to use an inheritance hierarchy to organize these
    
    abstract base class: entity
        will represent all sprites
