    // illustrate your answer

    //What is the significance of the constexpr keyword?
    // tells the compiler to calculate the value of whatever variable it's put in front of
    // also the value of the constexpr variables cannot be changed
    
    //â€¢ What is the difference between a "const" variable and a "constexpr" variable?
    // const is used for runtime operations, indicating that a variable will not be changed if forwarded to a function by reference,
    // or that a member function will not change the called object
    // constexpr variables are calculated in compile-time to be used with no time spent on operations on the variable
