There are three main ways to write exception-safe code:
    1) Basic exception guarantee
    2) Strong exception guarantee
    3) No-throw guarantee
    
1) Basic exception guarantee
    If an exception is thrown during an operation, no resources are leaked
    Files opened during the operation will be closed
    Memory allocated during the operation will be deallocated

2) Strong exception guarantee
    If an exception is thrown during an operation, the program reverts to its previous state
        As if the operation had never happened

3) No-throw guarantee
    The code doesn't throw any exceptions
