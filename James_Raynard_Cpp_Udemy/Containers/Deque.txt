Implements a double-ended queue
    Similar to a vector, but elements can also be added to front efficiently
    
Defined in <deque>

Implemented as a two-dim array
    std::vector has one memory block which stores all the elements
    std::list has one memory block per element
    std::deque has multiple memory blocks which each store several elements
        iterating from the first element of the first block to the last element of the last block will return all elements in order
        
similar interface with std::vector
    also implements push_front() to insert an element before the first one
        
if there's not enough room to store a new element, the deque will allocate another memory block and store it in there
    the existing elements keep their addresses
    this is different from std::vector, where the memory block is reallocated, and all the elements are copied into the new block
